The game's objective is to navigate a virtual snake through a walled-space while consuming food along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls, and their own snake. Since the length of the snake increases with each number consumed, the game increases in difficulty over time. After a particular no of food has been eaten(varies from level to level), the player progresses to the next level, with more complex obstacles and increased speed.
